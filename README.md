# BRFSS 2020 Survey Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the **BRFSS 2020 Survey Data**, a comprehensive health survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The survey collects data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the utilization of preventive services across the United States. This project aims to extract insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and regression analysis, providing valuable data that can be used to inform healthcare policy and improve public health.

## Key Areas of Analysis:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the survey data to uncover underlying patterns and distributions in the data, including visualization of health behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive services.
- **Statistical Testing**: Performed hypothesis testing to identify significant relationships and differences between variables.
- **Regression Analysis**: Developed regression models to predict health outcomes based on various risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity.

## Tools Used:
- **R**: Used for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and creating visualizations.
- **Excel**: Used for basic data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and additional charting.

## Key Insights:
- Identified key risk factors that contribute to chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
- Analyzed the impact of preventive services on reducing the prevalence of certain health conditions.
- Provided policy recommendations based on statistical findings to help improve public health initiatives and resource allocation.
